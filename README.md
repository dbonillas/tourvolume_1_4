# Concert listing Web Site
TourVolume built on symfony 1.4

**History**

I've ran a web site named Tour Volume.  Tour Volume was a Live Concert listing site that I ran from 2003 to 2015.  Tour Volume started as Live2nite.com and involved into Tour Volume.com (easier name to remember).

Also create another site named Tour Voltage.  Tour Voltage was built with the Band, Concert promoter, Talent Agency in mind. Tour Voltage allowed you to create a tour run, contact promoters and negotiate concerts.

Both sites were ran, designed and developed by me.

Both Tour Volume and Tour Voltage was written with a Lamp stack.  I used the symfony framework to build both (version 1.4). 

The sites were a sandbox for me to learn new technologies or try new ideas.  I also created an iPhone app and a mac widget based on the information and technology.

Tour Volume and Tour Voltage shared resources (libraries, configs and models).  I did this by creating a repo for each resource and symlinked the resources into each project.

I ended the sites in 2015 in hopes of bringing them back.
